        <h2>Plans After Graduation</h2>
        <p>I will not be transferring to another college. Instead, I want to start applying for jobs. At this moment, I would take any job in the software development field, especially a remote job or something close to home. Maybe I will start my own IT services business, working on whatever IT-related jobs I can find until I find employment at a company. I do need help with job searching because, honestly, I don't know where to start. I don't trust online job websites like Indeed because I've heard it's hard to find a job through them, as so many people apply for the same position. The first place I think about when looking for an IT job is Mr. Williams' internship opportunity. I always wondered if he will be offering that internship opportunity at Navarro College. Also, I never received my LinkedIn profile picture from last year job readiness conference, so I still don't have a photo on LinkIn.

        What I find interesting about the field of computer science is that there are so many ways to do things. I always thought there were set methods for building a program or website, but there are many different ways to achieve the same results. Additionally, I find it fascinating how slow coding can actually be. You spend more time thinking about how to build a program and checking for errors than typing on a keyboard. I always thought coding was more fast-paced.</p>

        <h3>List of Prefer Programming Languages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Javascript programming. I would like to focus on javascript because its the "native" programming language for the web because it goes together with HTML and CSS. I think web apps will continue to increase in popularity because they can be cross platform to many devices. </li>
            <li>C Programming because UNIX and all the operating systems are written in C. Also because it's one of the first programming languages and it integrates software with hardware. You learn how software and hardware combine.</li>
        </ul>
